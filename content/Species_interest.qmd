## Mobulids

- *Mobula birostris* (Giant devil Ray)
- *Mobula mobular* (Spinetail devil ray)
- *Mobula thurstoni* (Smooth tail or Bentfin devil ray)
- *Mobula tarapacana* (Chilean devil ray)
- *Mobula munkiana* (Munk's devil ray)

### Life history

Mobulids can reach 40+ years of age (*mobula birostris*) or 15 - 20 years for smaller species. They reach maturity between 6 - 8 years of age. They reproduce every 2 - 7 years, typically producing one pup per pregnancy. Mobulids have one of the lowest population growth among elasmobranch species, making them particularly vulnerable to population collapse.
