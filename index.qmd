Welcome to the Shared Seas Lab!

This site serves as the comprehensive lab manual for the Shared Seas Lab, located on UMass Dartmouth's [School for Marine Science and Technology](https://www.umassd.edu/smast/) campus within the Department of Fisheries Oceanography (DFO). 

The Shared Seas Lab uses interdisciplinary approaches to identify and implement mobulid bycatch mitigation strategies for eastern Pacific tuna fisheries.
